* MUST DO: Debug wonky camera move behavior
* DO SOON: Directly pass 4x1 SIMD vec for tx, ty, z into inner fill tile, instead
    of reconstructing from fill_interps and draw_interps

* MAYBE NEEDED: Hierarchial z-buffer
* ONLY IF NEEDED: Scale [near, far] to [1, 0]. Currently, it is [1, near / far].
    Gives extra precision near the far plane
* PROBABLY NOT NEEDED: Bilinear/linear texture mapping within 16x16 inner tile
